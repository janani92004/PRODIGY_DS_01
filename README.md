#Title: Distribution of Education In Cities According To Gender

This interactive visualization provides a detailed overview of the distribution of genders within different cities based on educational attainment. By leveraging Tableau's dynamic features, I've created an engaging representation that allows users to gain insights into the distribution of education attainment across various regions.

-City-wise Breakdown: The visualization presents a breakdown of educational attainment by gender for each city included in the dataset. Users can easily navigate through different cities to compare gender distributions.

-Gender Disparities: By visually comparing the proportions of male and female populations with varying levels of education in each city, users can quickly identify any significant gender disparities that may exist.

-Educational Levels: The visualization categorizes educational attainment into different levels such as PhD, Master's degree and Bachelor's degree. This allows viewers to understand the distribution of genders across various stages of academic achievement.

Working on my first task using Tableau to visualize gender distribution in education across cities was a significant learning experience for me.
